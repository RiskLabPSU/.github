# RISK Lab

The RISK Lab studies the anthropology of human health risks. We are interested in the role of human behavior and ecology in altering risk of zoonotic spillover, including how humans balance health-related trade-offs at the human-wildlife interface. A fundamental goal of our research is to identify and test evidence and community-based solutions that meet the needs of people locally, and identify "win-wins" for environmental, food and global health security.
